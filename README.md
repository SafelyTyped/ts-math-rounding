# Math Rounding Utilities for TypeScript

## Introduction

This TypeScript library adds missing math rounding utilities, in a type-safe manner.

## Quick Start

```
# run this from your Terminal
npm install @safelytyped/math-rounding
```

```typescript
// add this import to your Typescript code
import { roundDown } from "@safelytyped/math-rounding"
```

__VS Code users:__ once you've added a single import anywhere in your project, you'll then be able to auto-import anything else that this library exports.
